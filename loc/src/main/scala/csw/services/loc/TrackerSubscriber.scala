/**
 * This class distributes Location events from a LocatonTracker within a single ActorSystem of a component.
 *
 * Any client actor that Subscribes will receive Location messages. It then sends the TrackConnection message
 * to the TrackerSubscriber with a Connection to the TrackerSubscriber. This causes the LocationTracker to
 * send updates in the form of Location messages, which are then passed to the subscriber.
 *
 * Note that when the TrackConnection message is sent, the subscriber first receives an Unresolved message before
 * it receives an ResolvedAkkaLocation or ResolvedHttpLocation.
 *
 * It is also possible to send an UntrackConnection(connection) to the TrackerSubscriber to stop getting updates.
 *
 * The Actor watches the subscriber and will unsubscribe it if the subscriber terminates, but it doesn't untrack the connections.
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *   import TrackerSubscriber._
 *
 *   val trackerSubscriber = system.actorOf(TrackerSubscriber.props)
 *
 *   val c1 = HttpConnection("lgsTromboneHCD", ComponentType.HCD)
 *
 *   trackerSubscriber ! LocationService.Subscribe
 *
 *   // An actor wishing to receive Location messages
 *   trackerSubscriber ! TrackConnecton(c1)
 *
 *   // Later, it can stop receiving Location messages using
 *   trackerSubscriber ! UntrackConnection(c1)
 * </pre>
