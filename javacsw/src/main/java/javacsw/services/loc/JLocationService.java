/**
 * Java API for the Location Service
 *
 * The Location Service is based on Multicast DNS (AppleTalk, Bonjour) and can be used to register and lookup
 * akka and http based services in the local network.
 *
 * Every application using the location service should call the initInterface() method once at startup,
 * before creating any actors.
 *
 * Note: On a mac, you can use the command line tool dns-sd to browse the registered services.
 * On Linux use avahi-browse.

     * This method should be called before creating any actors or web services that depend on the location service.
     * <p>
     * Note that calling this method overrides any setting for akka.remote.artery.canonical.hostname in the akka config file.
     * Since the application config is immutable and cached once it is loaded, I can't think of a way to take the config
     * setting into account here. This should not be a problem, since we don't want to hard code host names anyway.
