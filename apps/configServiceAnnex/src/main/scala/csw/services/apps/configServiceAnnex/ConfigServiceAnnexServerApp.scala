/**
 * An HTTP server application that allows storing and retrieving files.
 * This is intended to be used by the config service to store large/binary
 * files.
 *
 * The URL format is http://host:port/filename, where filename is the SHA-1
 * hash of the file's contents.
 *
 * To upload a file, use POST, to download, use GET.
 * Use HEAD to check if a file already exists, DELETE to delete.
 * Files are immutable. (TODO: Should delete be available?)
