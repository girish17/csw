/**
 * DiagPublisher provides diagnostic telemetry in the form of two events. DiagPublisher operaties in the 'OperationsState' or 'DiagnosticState'.
 *
 * DiagPublisher listens in on axis state updates from the HCD and publishes them as a StatusEvent through the assembly's event publisher.
 * In OperationsState, it publishes every 5'th axis state update (set with val operationsSkipCount.
 * In DiagnosticState, it publishes every other axis update (more frequent in diagnostic state).
 *
 * context.become is used to implement a state machine with two states operationsReceive and diagnosticReceive
 *
 * In DiagnosticState, it also publishes an axis statistics event every second. Every one second (diagnosticAxisStatsPeriod), it
 * sends the GetAxisStats message to the HCD. When the data arrives, it is sent to the event publisher.
 *
 * This actor demonstrates a few techniques. First, it has no variables. Each state in the actor is represented by its own
 * receive method. Each method has parameters that can be called from within the function with updated values eliminating the need
 * for variables.
 *
 * This shows how to filter events from the CurrentState stream from the HCD.
 *
 * This shows how to use the TimeService to send periodic messages and how to periodically call another actor and process its
 * response.
 *
 * @param assemblyContext      the assembly context provides overall assembly information and convenience functions
 * @param currentStateReceiver a source for CurrentState messages. This can be the actorRef of the HCD itself, or the actorRef of
 *                             a CurrentStateReceiver
 * @param tromboneHCDIn        initial actorRef of the tromboneHCD as a [[scala.Option]]
 * @param eventPublisher     initial actorRef of an instance of the TrombonePublisher as [[scala.Option]]
